## Development Processes && Specifications
To ensure standardization of development and improve teamwork. Please observe the following:
* **Set Up Branching Strategy**: Generally, you can consider creating a **main branch (typically named main or master)** and **development branches**. The **main branch** can hold **stable versions**, while **development branches** are used for team members to work on specific features. This helps avoid making direct changes to the main branch and reduces potential conflicts.
* **Create Feature Branches**: For effective collaboration, it's recommended that team members create feature branches off the development branch for developing specific features or fixes. Once the feature development is complete, the branch can be merged back into the development branch to ensure code integration and stability.
* **Pull Requests (PRs) and Code Review**: After completing work on a feature branch, team members can create a Pull Request to merge it back into the development branch. This allows for code review, where team members can provide feedback and suggestions for improvement. At least one team member should review the code to ensure quality and consistency.
* **Regular Merging and Releases**: Periodically merge the development branch back into the main branch to keep the main branch up to-date and stable.
